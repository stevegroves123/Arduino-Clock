# Arduino-Clock
Clock using Arduino software

Ths code needs to be cleaned up and there are one or two (many) changes needed to make this "nice" looking, but the clock works.

Using an Xiao (very small Arduino clone) and a 128x64 oled, with the addition of three buttons this clock shows an analog clock face of the time.  When you press the enter button you get access to a menu that shows various user interactions; set an alarm (flash the display), turn on all OLED pixels (light), run a test, turn off all pixels (display off) and show a digital clock with date.
