# Arduino-Clock
Clock using Arduino software

Ths code needs to be clewaned up and there are one or two (many) changes needed to make this "nice" looking, but the clock works.

Using an Xiao (very small Arduino clone) and a 128x64 oled, with the addition of three buttons this clock shows an analog clock face of the time. The enter button accesses a menu that allows the user ton set an alarm (flash the display).
